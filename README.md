# 🎬 Netflix Data Analytics Dashboard  

Hello there! 👋  

This is my **first complete Data Analytics Dashboard project** where I tried to explore Netflix content using **Python and Power BI**.  
The idea was simple → take a raw dataset, clean it, and turn it into meaningful visuals that tell a story.

## 📊 What’s Inside the Dashboard?  

- 🎥 **Top 4 Directors** – Who has created the most Netflix titles?  
- ⏳ **Movie Duration Distribution** – Are most movies short or long?  
- 📺 **Movies vs TV Shows** – What does Netflix have more of?  
- 📅 **Year-wise Trends** – How Netflix grew over the years.  
- 🔖 **Ratings Breakdown** – What kind of audience is Netflix targeting?

## 🛠️ Tools I Used  

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** → for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.  
- **Power BI** → for building an interactive dashboard.  
- **Excel/CSV** → raw dataset format.
